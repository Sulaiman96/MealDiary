# MealDiary
The MealDiary app is a mobile application that allows users to keep track of the meals they have tried at different restaurants. 

Users can take a picture of the dish, input details such as cuisine, ingredients, and save the meal to their diary. They can also create custom lists to organize their meals and share their lists with friends on social media. Each user has an account that they can log in to using either an email/password or social media account, this way they can store all of their information and have access to it from anywhere.

The goal of this project is to provide a convenient and easy way for users to keep track of the meals they have tried and discover new meals. The app also allows users to share their meals with friends, making it a social experience. Additionally, the app provides a feature-rich, visually appealing and easy to use interface.

This project is built with React Native for the front-end, C#/.Net for the back-end, and Postgres for the database. And it's using Dapper for querying the database, this will be running on the ASP.NET Core framework and the architecture is following the RESTful API design pattern.

The MVP version of this project includes the core functionality of creating and managing meals, creating custom lists and sharing those lists with friends. And it also includes user authentication and authorization.
